Due to time contraints below are the remaining changes, which I wanted to implement,
but due to time constraints, submitting the project without implementing those:
1) exception handling
2) media query 
3) no data messages
4) sepration of data fetching api call from ui
5) loader to display when data is loading from api
6) UI look improvements
7) Logging needs to implement
8) test cases implementation
